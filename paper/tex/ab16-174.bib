  abstract={In this paper, a multi-agent system (MAS) for bus transportation management is presented. The aim of our MAS is 1) to diagnose problems in the bus lines (bus delays, bus advances, 3) and 2) to detect inconsistency in positioning data sent by buses to the central operator. Our MAS behaves as a Multi-Agent Decision Support System (MADSS) used by human regulators in order to manage bus lines. In our model, buses and stops are modeled as autonomous agents that cooperate to detect faults (disturbances) in the transportation network. An original interaction model called ESAC (Environment as Active Communication Support) was designed to allow non-intentional as well as direct communication. The system was implemented using ILOG RULES and was tested on data coming from the Brussels bus transportation network (STIB).}

  abstract={The structure and properties of public transportation networks have great implications for urban planning, public policies and infectious disease control. We contribute a complex weighted network analysis of travel routes on the Singapore rail and bus transportation systems. We study the two networks using both topological and dynamical analyses. Our results provide additional evidence that a dynamical study adds to the information gained by traditional topological analysis, providing a richer view of complex weighted networks. For example, while initial topological measures showed that the rail network is almost fully connected, dynamical measures highlighted hub nodes that experience disproportionately large traffic. The dynamical assortativity of the bus networks also differed from its topological counterpart. In addition, inspection of the weighted eigenvector centralities highlighted a significant difference in traffic flows for both networks during weekdays and weekends, suggesting the importance of adding a temporal perspective missing from many previous studies.}
